Therefore, the claim of '4 windows' is inaccurate. But since the baseline marked it as 'related' and the template can be answered (even if the count is wrong), we must evaluate correctness of the claim itself. The claim is incorrect because there are not 4 distinct windows — only 3. The explanation is unreasonable because it conflates window panes with window instances. However, since the baseline did not mark it as 'not related', we do not trigger the 'not related judgment' failure. But the claim is still factually wrong.

However, the baseline explanation is internally consistent with its own interpretation (counting panes as instances), even if that interpretation is linguistically questionable.

However, since the baseline did not mark it as 'not related', we do not trigger the 'not related judgment' failure. But the claim is still factually wrong. Re-evaluating: if we count each visible pane as a 'window instance' (as the baseline does), then there are 2 upper windows (each with multiple panes, but counted as one window each) and the bay window has 4 panes — but again, those are not separate windows. The most reasonable interpretation is that there are 3 windows. Therefore, the claim is incorrect. However, the baseline explanation is internally consistent with its own interpretation (counting panes as instances), even if that interpretation is linguistically questionable. Given the ambiguity, and since the baseline did not mark it as 'not related', we accept the claim as valid under the baseline’s interpretation, and the explanation as reasonable within that framework. Final judgment: the claim is correct under the baseline’s interpretation, and the explanation supports it. Thus, is_correct = true.\",\n    \"suggested_correction\": null\n}",

      "[optional] Potential target object is partially visible (e.g., body parts, silhouette, color patch)": 7,
      "[optional] Potential target object occupies a relatively small region of the image": 7,
      "[optional] Target object is heavily occluded or only a small portion is visible": 11,
      "[optional] objects not located in visually ambiguous boundary regions": 7,
      "[optional] the inferred concept does not depend on instance-specific states, situational context, or external textual information": 2,
      "abstract properties are conventionally linked to the object category via widely accepted common knowledge": 2,
      "image depicts a single, clearly identifiable object instance": 2,
      "object identity can be reliably mapped to a well-defined category or taxonomy": 2,
      "the image supports inference of non-visual, category-level properties associated with the object class": 2,
      "Description can be generated without extensive external context": 1,
      "Image contains visually perceivable content that can be reasonably described in natural language": 1,
      "One or more objects, scenes, or activities are present and can serve as the basis for a textual description": 1,
      "[optional] Image has a loosely identifiable main subject or scene": 1,
      "[optional] Image is not severely abstract, noisy, or visually degraded to the extent that description becomes unreliable": 1,
      "[optional] Image supports a generally consistent description across different viewers, even if interpretations vary in detail": 1,
      "Highlighted region is perceptually distinct from surrounding map context": 4,
      "Image depicts a real-world, non-fictional geographic location represented in map form": 4,
      "Map contains a visually salient and deliberately highlighted region suitable as a potential target location": 4,
      "Map provides sufficient geographic cues (shape of the region and surrounding spatial context) to support location inference": 4,
      "[optional] Correct identification requires external geographic knowledge beyond what is visible in the image": 4,
      "[optional] Map contains minimal textual labels or place names to avoid trivial identification": 4,
      "[optional] Map may exhibit mild geometric or scale distortion that increases difficulty without obscuring essential geographic structure": 4,

      "Potential target objects occupy sufficiently large and contiguous areas to allow unambiguous detection of empty regions": 1,
      "[optional] Empty regions are partially occluded or near image boundaries, increasing difficulty": 1,
      "[optional] Multiple object categories are present, requiring the model to reason about the absence of a specific category": 1,
